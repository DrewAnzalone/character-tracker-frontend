# Character Tracker
Our group chose to make an app where users can create character sheets and add items (equips) to their sheet to dynamically update their stats. Our project allow users to create, read, update and delete these sheets while allowing users to create/add their own equips, or use equips already in our database.

## Getting started
You can find our [deployed site here](https://character-tracker.netlify.app/)

Our planning materials [can be found here](https://trello.com/b/IFw6AVnT/charcter-gear-wip-name)

## Technologies Used: 
1. **JSX**
    * JSX was used to provide visual tex and buttons/links within the website
    * JSX is really what allows the user to explore our website.
2. **CSS**
    * CSS was used for styling the site
    * By implementing CSS we were able to give our website a better feel and make it easier to navigate through the website.
3. **Javascript**
    * Javascript was mostly used in the back-end of the website, but was also used for our front-end services.
    * Javascript houses all the background code that allows a user to sign-in/sign-up and create their sheets and equips.
4. **React**
    * React was the basis of the entire website
    * By using React we were able to make our website functionable by importing and exporting diffrent variables and functions.


## Stretch Goals
Theres a few things we would like to add to our website to make it more user-friendly

1. **Expanding what a user can add to an item**
    * Adding a way for a user to add abilities to an item and possibly even their character

2. **Creating Parties**
    * Allowing a user to make one or more parties that are made up of the character sheets that they have created
