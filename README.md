# Character Tracker
We chose to make a 

![Sopranos Hangman Website](https://i.imgur.com/RwmSnml.png)

## Getting started
You can find the [deployed game here](https://michaelmcbride113.github.io/Sopranos-hangman-game/)

My planning materials [can be found here](https://github.com/michaelmcbride113/Sopranos-hangman-game/blob/main/js/psuedocode.js)


## Attributions
### Hangman images
 - I was having trouble finding sequential updated hangman images for my game. I ended up finding a [Javascript hangman game](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-a-hangman-game-using-javascript/?utm_source=auth&utm_medium=saved&utm_campaign=articles) through Google and used their images for my game.
 ### MDN
-  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I used MDN when I was unable to come up with/find code that's applicable in my lecture notes or lab work. For example, I could not figure out how to update my hangman images with an incorrect guess so I used the [innerHTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) which I found on MDN.

## Technologies Used: 
1. **HTML**
    * HTML was used to write all the text on the website
    * HTML was incredibly helpful when creating the site as it is the backbone of my whole project
2. **CSS**
    * CSS was used for styling the site
    * Before implementing the CSS, my game was working but it was incredibly ugly to look at and did not provide a good user experience
3. **Javascript**
    * Javascript is where I spent the vast majority of my time working on the website
    * Javascript houses all the background code that makes my site function the way it does and makes my game playable.
4. **data.js**
    * I used a data.js file to house the answers for my game. The data.js file allowed me to keep data seperate from my Javascript file and keep my workspace cleaner and more organized.


## Next steps
There were quite a few things I wanted to include in my site but I was unable to due to time limitations and my current skill level 

1. **Add in locations and quotes as options for answers**
* 

2. **Update images with images I make myself**
* 
3. **Update website to mirror website from the show**
