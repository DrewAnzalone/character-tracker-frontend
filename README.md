# Character Tracker
We chose to make a 

![Sopranos Hangman Website](https://i.imgur.com/RwmSnml.png)

## Getting started
You can find the [deployed game here](https://michaelmcbride113.github.io/Sopranos-hangman-game/)

My planning materials [can be found here](https://github.com/michaelmcbride113/Sopranos-hangman-game/blob/main/js/psuedocode.js)


## Attributions
### Hangman images
 - I was having trouble finding sequential updated hangman images for my game. I ended up finding a [Javascript hangman game](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-a-hangman-game-using-javascript/?utm_source=auth&utm_medium=saved&utm_campaign=articles) through Google and used their images for my game.
 ### MDN
-  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I used MDN when I was unable to come up with/find code that's applicable in my lecture notes or lab work. For example, I could not figure out how to update my hangman images with an incorrect guess so I used the [innerHTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) which I found on MDN.

## Technologies Used: 
1. **JSX**
    * JSX was used to provide visual tex and buttons/links within the website
    * JSX is really what allows the user to explore our website.
2. **CSS**
    * CSS was used for styling the site
    * By implementing CSS we were able to give our website a better feel and make it easier to navigate through the website.
3. **Javascript**
    * Javascript was mostly used in the back-end of the website, but was also used for our front-end services.
    * Javascript houses all the background code that allows a user to sign-in/sign-up and create their sheets and equips.
4. **React**
    * React was the basis of the entire website
    * By using React we were able to make our website functionable by importing and exporting diffrent variables and functions.


## Stretch Goals
Theres a few things we would like to add to our website to make it more user-friendly

1. **Expanding what a user can add to an item**
    * Adding a way for a user to add abilities to an item and possibly even their character

2. **Creating Parties**
    * Allowing a user to make one or more parties that are made up of the character sheets that they have created
